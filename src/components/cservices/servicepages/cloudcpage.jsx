            <p>
              Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves
              delivering hosted services over the internet. These services are
              divided into three main categories or types of cloud computing:
              infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS)
              and software as a service (SaaS).It is process to manage and
              deploy applications on high end cloud servers. Companies instead
              of buying huge infra or servers they buy server space and as per
              their usage they make payments. This helps in company save time
              and money in managing servers and related employees. Hence Cloud
              computing technologoes like AWS, Azure etc is in Boom today.
